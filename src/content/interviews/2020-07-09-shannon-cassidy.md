LCL: What do you value in a photograph?

SC: If you have seen my work you will know i value colour and light. Composition is also a big deal for me, I’m a little bit OCD when it comes to trying to get my capture symmetrical and in the right composition. Seeing good composition in someone else's work is a satisfying feeling for me, it means they have a good eye in seeing what is art or what can be interpreted into art. I am a major perfectionist when it comes to photography. It's a blessing and a curse I always say ha-ha.



Describe your work in three words

Creative, methodical and colourful.

Where does your inspiration come from?

A big inspiration of mine is photographer Brandon Woelfel. I came across him over a year ago on Instagram whilst being bored. I looked on his page and I was just in awe of his work. It made me realize this is what I want to do. This is exactly what I love: the cold colours, the use of lights, bokeh, his creativeness in his portraits. It was almost too good to be true.



What is it about photography that you enjoy the most?

What I enjoy most is getting to do long exposure. This has to be done during the night as it is vital for this to work. I feel it makes my photography or anyone’s photography look more exciting and engaging as it's something different from the norm. When I see a good opportunity for capturing long exposure I'm on it straight away whether it's car light trails, star trails, capturing long exposure light reflections in the sea or puddles. But it needs to have an exciting vibe about it, so I wouldn't take the photo just for the sake of it, I would need to see and feel if it would be an exciting capture and if I would be able to edit it in my style, if that makes sense.



How have people influenced your work through creating portraits?

When I see a portrait of someone, usually it's just a person in the centre of a photo looking serious, this to me seems boring and not exciting. When I create portraits, they need to be creative and have something astonishing about them. So while observing other photographers portraits they could either intrigue me and make me want to copy them in my own way (a lot like Brandon Woelfel's work), or not interest me at all.



What do you want to be when you grow up?

When I grow up I want to be an Astrophotographer for NASA because I love taking photos of the night sky, the stars and trying to capture the milky way and it would be amazing if I could capture something beyond the night sky e.g. nebula clouds or even planets. It's an ambitious and a 'really-out-there' job but that's why I like it, and I've always been fascinated by the night sky and the constellations. Taking photos for a company like NASA would be an absolute honour and dream come true, however I still would want to do the photography art work I'm currently doing today as I enjoy it, but maybe as a side thing.
